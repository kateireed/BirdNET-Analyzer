Command line interface
======================

.. _cli-docs:

birdnet_analyzer.analyze
------------------------

.. argparse::
   :ref: birdnet_analyzer.cli.analyzer_parser
   :prog: birdnet_analyzer.analyze

   Run ``birdnet_analyzer.analyze`` to analyze an audio file or a directory containing audio files.
   You need to set paths for the audio file and selection table output. Here is an example:

   .. code:: bash

      python -m birdnet_analyzer.analyze /path/to/audio/folder -o /path/to/output/folder

   Here are two example commands to run this BirdNET version:

   .. code:: bash

      python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.analyze example/ --slist example/ --min_conf 0.5 --threads 4

      python3 -m birdnet_analyzer.analyze example/ --lat 42.5 --lon -76.45 --week 4 --sensitivity 1.0

   Directory analyses are resumable: progress is saved continuously to a
   ``.birdnet-resume`` folder in the output directory, so an interrupted run (crash,
   power loss, Ctrl+C) can be continued by re-running the same command — files that
   were already analyzed are skipped. The settings that affect the detections have to
   match the interrupted run, otherwise the analysis starts over; see
   :ref:`resumable-analysis` for details.

birdnet_analyzer.embeddings
---------------------------

.. argparse::
   :ref: birdnet_analyzer.cli.embeddings_parser
   :prog: birdnet_analyzer.embeddings

   Run ``birdnet_analyzer.embeddings`` to extract feature embeddings instead of class predictions.
   Result file will contain timestamps and lists of float values representing the embedding for a particular 3-second segment.
   Embeddings can be used for clustering or similarity analysis. Here is an example:

   .. code:: bash

      python -m birdnet_analyzer.embeddings example/ --threads 4 --batch_size 16

.. _cli-segments:

birdnet_analyzer.segments
-------------------------

.. argparse::
   :ref: birdnet_analyzer.cli.segments_parser
   :prog: birdnet_analyzer.segments

   After the analysis, run ``birdnet_analyzer.segments`` to extract short audio segments for species detections to verify results.
   This way, it might be easier to review results instead of loading hundreds of result files manually.

.. _cli-species:

birdnet_analyzer.species
-------------------------

The year-round list may contain some species, that are not included in any list for a specific week. See `birdnet-team#211 <https://github.com/birdnet-team/BirdNET-Analyzer/issues/211#issuecomment-1849833360>`_ for more details.

.. argparse::
   :ref: birdnet_analyzer.cli.species_parser
   :prog: birdnet_analyzer.species

birdnet_analyzer.train
-------------------------

.. argparse::
   :ref: birdnet_analyzer.cli.train_parser
   :prog: birdnet_analyzer.train

   You can train your own custom classifier on top of BirdNET.
   This is useful if you want to detect species that are not included in the default species list.
   You can also use this to train a classifier for a specific location or season.
   
   All you need is a dataset of labeled audio files, organized in folders by species (we use folder names as labels).
   This also works for non-bird species, as long as you have a dataset of labeled audio files.
   
   Audio files will be resampled to 48 kHz and converted into 3-second segments (we support different crop segmentation modes for files longer than 3 seconds; we pad with random noise if the file is shorter). We recommend using at least 100 audio files per species (although training also works with less data).
   
   You can download a sample training data set `here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/16hgka5aJ4U69ane9RQn_quVmgjVY2AY5/edit>`_.

   1. Collect training data and organize in folders based on species names.
   2. Species labels should be in the format ``<scientific name>_<species common name>`` (e.g., ``Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee``), but other formats work as well.
   3. It can be helpful to include a non-event class. If you name a folder 'Noise', 'Background', 'Other' or 'Silence', it will be treated as a non-event class.
   4. Run the training script with ``python -m birdnet_analyzer.train <path to training data folder> -o <path to trained classifier model output>``.

   **The script saves the trained classifier model based on the best validation loss achieved during training. This ensures that the model saved is optimized for performance according to the chosen metric.**

   After training, you can use the custom trained classifier with the ``--classifier`` argument of the ``birdnet_analyzer.analyze`` script.
   If you want to use the custom classifier in Raven, make sure to set ``--model_formats raven``.

   .. note::
      Adjusting hyperparameters (e.g., number of hidden units, learning rate, etc.) can have a big impact on the performance of the classifier.
      We recommend trying different hyperparameter settings. If you want to automate this process, you can use the ``--autotune`` argument (in that case, make sure to install the ``train`` extra with ``pip install birdnet_analyzer[train]``, which provides ``optuna``).

   **Example usage** (when downloading and unzipping the sample training data set):

   .. code:: bash

      python -m birdnet_analyzer.train train_data/ -o checkpoints/custom/Custom_Classifier.tflite
      python -m birdnet_analyzer.analyze example/ --classifier checkpoints/custom/Custom_Classifier.tflite

   .. note::
      Setting a custom classifier will also set the new labels file. Due to these custom labels, the location filter and locale will be disabled.
   
   **Negative samples**

   You can include negative samples for classes by prefixing the folder names with a '-' (e.g., ``-Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee``).
   Do this with samples that definitely do not contain the species.
   Negative samples will only be used for training and not for validation.
   Also keep in mind that negative samples will only be used when a corresponding folder with positive samples exists.
   Negative samples cannot be used for binary classification, instead include these samples in the non-event folder.

   **Multi-label data**

   To train with multi-label data separate the class labels with commas in the folder names (e.g., ``Poecile atricapillus_Black-capped Chickadee,Cardinalis cardinalis_Northern Cardinal``).
   This can also be combined with negative samples as described above.
   The validation split will be performed combination of classes, so you might want to ensure sufficient data for each combination of classes.
   When using multi-label data the upsampling mode will be limited to 'repeat'.
